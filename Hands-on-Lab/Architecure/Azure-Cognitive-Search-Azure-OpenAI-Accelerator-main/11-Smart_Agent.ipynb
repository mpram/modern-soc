    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 90k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We manually loaded an index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools and built the first Skill/Agent, that can do RAG over a search engine\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We build a second Agent (Pandas) in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 09**: We used another  Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",
    "- **Notebook 10**: We built an API Agent that can translate a question into the right API calls, giving us the capability to talk to any datasource that provides a RESTFul API.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Increased Severity and Complications**: Obese patients are more likely to develop severe COVID-19. A study involving 383 hospitalized patients in Shenzhen, China, found that obese patients had a 3.40-fold increased odds of developing severe disease compared to those with normal weight, after adjusting for various factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities [[1]](https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409502/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cardiac Complications**: Obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients, including myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death. These complications are closely linked to in-hospital mortality [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365275/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Higher ICU Admissions**: Data from the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre indicated that nearly 72% of critically ill COVID-19 patients were either overweight or obese, underscoring the impact of obesity on the severity of the disease [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314871/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Theoretical Mechanisms**: Obesity may exacerbate COVID-19 outcomes through several mechanisms, including increased viral spread and immune activation due to adipose tissue acting as a reservoir for the virus. This can lead to cytokine amplification and a more severe inflammatory response [[4]](https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314868/?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",

       "**docsearch**: CLP stands for **Constraint Logic Programming**, which is an extension of conventional logic programming. It integrates constraint solving into logic programming languages, allowing for more expressive and powerful programming paradigms. Here are some key points about CLP:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Definition and Origin**: The term CLP was first introduced by Jaffar and Lassez in 1986. It represents a general framework for a logic programming language that is parameterized with respect to a constraint language and a domain of computation. This framework ensures soundness and completeness for an operational semantics that relies on a constraint solver for the employed constraint language [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Applications and Extensions**: CLP has been extended and refined for various applications, including linguistic knowledge representation and feature-based constraint languages. For example, it has been used to embed logical languages into constraint logic programs, enabling the operational treatment of declaratively specified grammars [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Technical Aspects**: CLP involves the use of constraint solvers that map constraints to true or false in finite time. The constraints are first-order formulas that include always satisfiable constraints (true), unsatisfiable constraints (false), and are closed under variable renaming, conjunction, and existential quantification. The associated domain is denoted as \\( D_C \\) [[2]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0701/0701082v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Quantitative and Probabilistic Extensions**: There are also quantitative and probabilistic extensions of CLP. Quantitative CLP uses fuzzy set algebra to provide a formal semantics for quantitative inference, while probabilistic CLP specifies a probability distribution over proof trees or parses and uses statistical methods to infer model parameters from empirical data [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0008/0008036v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, CLP is a versatile and powerful extension of logic programming that incorporates constraint solving, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from software verification to linguistic knowledge representation."

       "\n",
       "**CLP** stands for **Classification, Labelling and Packaging**. It is a regulation of the European Union, specifically Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, which aligns the EU system of classification, labelling, and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures to the Globally Harmonised System (GHS) of the United Nations. The primary objectives of the CLP Regulation are:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Protection of Health and Environment**: Ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment.\n",
       "2. **Free Movement**: Facilitating the free movement of substances, mixtures, and articles within the EU.\n",
       "3. **Hazard Communication**: Providing a clear and consistent system for hazard communication through labels and safety data sheets.\n",
       "\n",
       "The regulation requires manufacturers, importers, and downstream users to classify, label, and package their hazardous chemicals appropriately before placing them on the market. This involves identifying the hazards of the substances or mixtures and comparing the hazard information with the criteria laid down in the CLP Regulation [[1]](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp) [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLP_Regulation).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Key Points of CLP Regulation\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Self-Classification**: Manufacturers, importers, and downstream users are responsible for the classification of substances and mixtures.\n",
       "- **Harmonised Classification**: Some substances have a harmonised classification and labelling at the EU level to ensure consistent hazard communication.\n",
       "- **Notification**: Companies must notify the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) of the classification and labelling of substances they place on the market.\n",
       "- **Labelling and Packaging**: Hazard labels must include specific information such as hazard pictograms, signal words, hazard statements, precautionary statements, and the identity of the supplier.\n",
       "\n",
       "For more detailed information, you can refer to the [ECHA website](https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp) and the [Wikipedia page on CLP Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLP_Regulation)."

       "An NP-complete problem is a type of problem in computational complexity theory that is both in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) and NP-hard. Here are the key points about NP-complete problems:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Class NP**: This class includes decision problems for which a given solution can be verified as correct or incorrect in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. Essentially, if you are given a solution, you can check its correctness quickly (in polynomial time) [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9906/9906006v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **NP-hard**: A problem is NP-hard if every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time. This means that an NP-hard problem is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. However, NP-hard problems are not necessarily in NP themselves; they might not have solutions that can be verified in polynomial time [[2]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9906/9906006v2.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **NP-complete**: A problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. This means that it is one of the hardest problems in NP, and if you can solve one NP-complete problem in polynomial time, you can solve all problems in NP in polynomial time. The concept of NP-completeness was first introduced by Stephen Cook in 1971 with the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) being the first known NP-complete problem [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/0604/0604113v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Polynomial-time Reduction**: To prove that a problem is NP-complete, one typically shows that an already known NP-complete problem can be reduced to the new problem in polynomial time. This involves transforming instances of the known NP-complete problem into instances of the new problem in such a way that the new problem's solution corresponds to the solution of the original problem [[2]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9906/9906006v2.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Significance**: The significance of NP-complete problems lies in the P vs NP question, which asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (NP) can also be quickly solved (P). If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then P = NP. Conversely, if no NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then P ≠ NP. This is one of the most important open questions in computer science [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/pdf/9906/9906006v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "### 1. **Teach the Importance of Boundaries**\n",
       "Children need to understand that boundaries are essential for their safety and well-being. Teaching them to say \"no\" helps them feel empowered and safe in a world that can be manipulative and exploitative. For example, children should be able to say things like \"No,\" \"I disagree,\" \"I will not,\" \"Stop that,\" and \"It hurts\" [[1]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **Model and Respect Boundaries**\n",
       "Parents should model good boundary-setting behavior and respect their children's boundaries. For instance, if a child does not want to hug a relative, parents should support their decision and explain to the relative that the child is learning to set personal boundaries [[2]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Encourage Safe Expression of \"No\"**\n",
       "Children should feel safe to express their disagreement or refusal. Parents should not withdraw emotionally or become enraged when a child says no. Instead, they should help the child feel that their \"no\" is just as lovable as their \"yes\" [[3]](https://datasetsgptsmartsearch.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rl&se=2026-07-09T13:52:04Z&st=2024-07-09T05:52:04Z&spr=https&sig=9Nx31tWOzf6CWylUZnGaciT9VDWVJSJ9vQulMcshm7Q%3D).\n",

       "### 5. **Avoid Overcontrol**\n",
       "While it is important to protect children, overcontrolling them can lead to dependency and difficulty in setting and keeping firm boundaries.

       "\n",
       "### 7. **Support System**\n",
       "Parents should establish a support system that encourages boundary setting. This can include co-dependency groups, therapists, marriage counselors, or pastors.
