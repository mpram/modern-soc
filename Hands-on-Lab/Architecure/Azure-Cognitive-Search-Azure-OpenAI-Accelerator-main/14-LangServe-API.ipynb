    "Let's first review what we have accomplished so far in deploying our Smart Bot:\n",

    "1) **Notebook 12**: Instructions on deploying a Backend API using the Azure Bot Service.\n",
    "2) **Notebook 13**: Guidelines on interfacing with the Bot Service programmatically using POST requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the pros and cons of using the Bot Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Easily connects to multiple channels, including O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat plugins, etc.\n",
    "- The Bot Framework Python SDKs provide numerous utilities like typing indicators, proactive messages, cards, file uploads, etc.\n",
    "- Includes built-in authentication and logging mechanisms, requiring minimal effort from us.\n",
    "- Offers SDKs for Python, JavaScript, and .NET.\n",
    "- Enables easy integration with the Application Insights Service for application monitoring.\n",
    "- Like other Microsoft services, it is backed by the Microsoft product and support teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Does not yet support streaming.\n",
    "- Lacks support for private endpoints.\n",
    "- As a service, it cannot be containerized or run on Kubernetes, container apps, etc.\n",
    "- Requires a steeper learning curve to fully understand all its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, in this notebook, we will build another Backend API using FastAPI with LangServe. <br>This API is self-contained, allowing it to be packaged in a Docker container and deployed anywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will zip the code and upload it to a new slot in the same Azure Web App service where the BotService API resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [LANGSERVE DOCUMENTATION](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve):\n",
    "\n",
    "    LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain runnables and chains as a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This library is integrated with FastAPI and uses pydantic for data validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In addition, it provides a client that can be used to call into runnables deployed on a server. A JavaScript client is available in LangChain.js."

      "\n",
      "Obesity has been identified as a significant risk factor for the severity of COVID-19, leading to more serious symptoms and negative prognoses for infected individuals. Here are some key impacts of COVID-19 on obese individuals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Increased Risk of Severe Disease**: Studies have shown that obese patients with COVID-19 have increased odds of progressing to severe disease. They are more likely to exhibit symptoms such as cough and fever compared to non-obese patients. Additionally, men who are obese have increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 compared to those with normal weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Higher Likelihood of Serious Complications**: The World Health Organization (WHO) considers obesity as a major risk factor for becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. Data from the UK Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre indicated that two-thirds of people who developed serious or fatal COVID-19-related complications were overweight or obese.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Role of Obesity in Pathogenesis**: Obesity plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, leading to consequences such as inflammation of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. This highlights the need for increased vigilance, testing priority, and therapy for COVID-19 patients with higher BMI and other co-morbidities, especially in the elderly population.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings underscore the importance of closely managing and providing prompt and aggressive treatment to obese patients infected with COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How COVID-19 Affects Elderly People\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 significantly affects elderly people, leading to a greater incidence and severity of the disease. Here are some key impacts of COVID-19 on the elderly:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Higher Risk of Severe Illness and Mortality**: Elderly individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing more serious and potentially fatal illness associated with COVID-19. Mortality data indicates a significant risk of mortality for people in their 60s, 70s, and over 80s. In Spain, a high percentage of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age, highlighting the severity of the impact on the elderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Social Isolation and Vulnerability**: The global recommendation for older populations includes social isolation, which involves staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, possibly for an extended period of time. This is particularly important for people over 70 years, and 50 years in some particularly vulnerable Indigenous populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Biopsychosocial Care and Personalized Decisions**: There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, and other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transmission Reduction Measures**: Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to the biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy, are proposed as innovative alternatives to support the elderly population.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Impact on Drug Therapy and Clinical Therapeutics**: The COVID-19 pandemic presents medical and social issues for older people, impacting the safety and efficacy of drug therapy. This includes implications for pharmacy practice, clinical therapeutics, and possible new treatments for the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and support for the elderly population to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on this vulnerable demographic.\n",
